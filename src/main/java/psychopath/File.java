     *           encoded characters when randomly accessing the bytes of the file.

     *           For non-<em>line-optimal</em> charsets the stream source's spliterator has poor
     *           splitting properties, similar to that of a spliterator associated with an iterator
     *           or that associated with a stream returned from {@link BufferedReader#lines()}. Poor
     *           splitting properties can result in poor parallel stream performance.

     *           For <em>line-optimal</em> charsets the stream source's spliterator has good
     *           splitting properties, assuming the file contains a regular sequence of lines. Good
     *           splitting properties can result in good parallel stream performance. The
     *           spliterator for a <em>line-optimal</em> charset takes advantage of the charset
     *           properties (a line feed or a carriage return being efficient identifiable) such
     *           that when splitting it can approximately divide the number of covered lines in
     *           half.

     * @throws SecurityException In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *             installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead} method is
